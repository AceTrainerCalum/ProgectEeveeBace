hey, im ace and this is a written file version of my totorial.

first go to , https://discord.com/developers/applications ,
if this is your first time on this application then you will need to log in to your discord account and make an Application,

optional;

General Information: 
you can change the name,
you can change the description,
you can change the app icon.

OAuth2;

do NOT let people see your CLIENT SECRET and if some one finds this out you can press Regenerate,
in the scopes tab, you can:
press bot then click the BOT PERMISSIONS,

you could just give the bot Administrator (but this will require you to have Administrator ( or server owner status))
or you could give the permissions you want the bot will not need any VOICE PERMISSIONS

but will need some General and text permissions:

i recomend;

General permissions:

manage channels
view channels
Text Permissions:

send messages
manage messages
Attach files

thank you for reading i hope you enjoy this modual from my eevee progect when i add more things such as kick ban or music i will make a new progect and a way to set it up for you!
